# This is program that identifies data types
# in Python then coverts the data types into
# other data types

#convert from int to float:
x = float(1)

#convert from float to int:
y = int(2.8)

#convert from int to complex:
z = complex(x)

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
